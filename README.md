# FlowSolverRHEA

RHEA - an open-source Reproducible Hybrid-architecture flow solver Engineered for Academia

Rhea was the Titaness great Mother of the Gods, and goddess of female fertility, motherhood, and generation. Her name means "flow" and "ease", representing the eternal flow of time and generations with ease.

The flow solver RHEA solves the conservation equations of fluid motion for single-phase compressible flows by means of second-order central finite-differences in combination with a Harten-Lax-van Leer-Contact (HLLC) Riemann solver, and utilizes an explicit third-order strong-stability-preserving Runge-Kutta (SSP-RK3) method for time integration. RHEA is written in C++, using object-oriented programming, utilizes YAML and HDF5 for input/output operations, and targets hybrid supercomputing architectures.
