RHEA DEVELOPMENT AGENDA:

- Change class name printer to ManagerHDF5?
- Change class name domain to ComputationalDomain?
- Change class name comm_scheme to ParallelTopology?
- Change class name parvec to DistributedArray?
- Change class name parameters to GlobalParameters?
- Change *.h to *.hpp to make it c++ standard
- Parallel scheme has to be introduced via FlowSolverRHEA?
- Remove _DEBUG_, _lNx_, _lNy_, _lNz_ from FlowSolverRHEA 
- Clean output debug information
- Rethink/homogenize global parameters (e.g., RHEA_NX, _PERIODIC_, _WEST_, _ALL_)
- Simplify/improve boundary conditions names and input
- Simplify i,j,k for loops notation?
- Homogenize nomenclature and notation
- Improve code implementation in all files
- Homogenize and improve layout/aesthetics
- Create initial gitlab "release" (clean/remove non-essential files, prepare make file, instructions, etc)



- ...

- Incorporate message that HDF5 labels cannot include special characters
- Create/check destructors of Willy's classes
- Improve code implementation in all files
- Homogenize nomenclature and notation
- Homogenize and improve layout/aesthetics
- Check that it compiles and runs with different compilers (gcc, clang, intel, etc)
- Verify numerics and parallelization with different number of processes (including 1)
