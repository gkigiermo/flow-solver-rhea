RHEA DEVELOPMENT AGENDA:

- Fix problem with HDF5 writing 
- Incorporate time (in seconds) in HDF5 write method
- Check/finalize HDF5 read in FlowSolverRHEA ... ask Willy
- Create iterators for hdf5 input/output (inner and boundaries, no halo)
- Change class name printer to ManagerHDF5?
- Change class name domain to ComputationalDomain?
- Change class name comm_scheme to ParallelTopology?
- Change class name parvec to DistributedArray?
- Change class name parameters to GlobalParameters?
- Change *.h to hpp to make it c++ standard
- Problem running with 1 cpu
- Question from Lluis to Willy: Halo updates are not necessary in timeAdvanceConservedVariables, right?
- Parallel scheme has to be introduced via FlowSolverRHEA?
- Remove _DEBUG_, _lNx_, _lNy_, _lNz_ from FlowSolverRHEA 
- Rethink/homogenize global parameters (e.g., RHEA_NX, _PERIODIC_, _WEST_, _ALL_)
- Simplify/improve boundary conditions names and input
- Modify mesh->updateBocos(bocos_type) to mesh->setBocos(bocos_type)
- Simplify i,j,k for loops notation?
- Homogenize nomenclature and notation
- Improve code implementation in all files
- Homogenize and improve layout/aesthetics
- Create initial gitlab "release" (clean/remove non-essential files, prepare make file, instructions, etc)



- ...

- Create iterators for hdf5 stuff (inner and boundaries, no halo)
- Improve code implementation in all files
- Homogenize nomenclature and notation
- Homogenize and improve layout/aesthetics
- Check that it compiles with different compilers
- Verify numerics and parallelization with different number of processes (including 1)
- ...
